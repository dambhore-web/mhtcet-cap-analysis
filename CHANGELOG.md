# Changelog

## Unreleased
### Added
- Foundation documentation: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/` tree, ADR-001
  to ADR-005, task files. Why: the project is becoming a paid, AI-assisted product and needs
  written rules, architecture and decisions before more code.
- `src/pdf.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`: start of the TypeScript port (ADR-001).

- AG-002 Data Ingestion Agent: spec, agent registry, pipeline tools, Claude Code subagent
  `.claude/agents/data-ingestion.md`, ADR-006. Why: the owner wants one agent that gathers and
  parses the data the app needs. Official cutoff lists found on the CET Cell site become the
  primary source.

### Changed
- `.gitignore`: ignore `node_modules/`, build output and env files.

## 2026-09-27 — initial scaffold (7e0b14f)
- Python download and parser scripts, COEP 2026 dashboard, README.
